# Quiz Game

* In this repository I have just created a small quiz game in python.
## Working
* First user will be asked to enter the name.
* In this game, there are some questions which are asked and count the scores according to the appropriate answers and at the end user will see the total score and finally the user will be asked to choose whether he wants to give rating or not and if the user wants to enter rating, if the user have entered the rating, the user name, score and rating will be saved in the txt file.
